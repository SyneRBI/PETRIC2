## Welcome to PETRIC 2!

(If you have not heard about PETRIC before, you can find out about it [here](https://github.com/SyneRBI/PETRIC).)

## What's the same?
We are going to solve a maximum a-posteriori estimate (MAP) using the smoothed relative difference prior (RDP) reconstruction problem and the aim of the challenge is to reach the target image quality as fast as possible.
We will provide you with PET sinogram phantom data from different scanners and an example repository on GitHub with an implementation of a reference algorithm.
There will be a leaderboard which is continuously updated to make sure you know how you are doing.

## What's new?
This time we are going to make things more challenging! The PET sinogram data will be created from fewer counts which means your algorithm will have to cope with more noise in the data. 

## Timeline
- Start of the challenge: 1 November 2025
- End of the challenge: 15 February 2026

## Awards
The winners of PETRIC2 will be announced as part of the Symposium on AI & Reconstruction for Biomedical Imaging taking place from 9 â€“ 10 March 2026 in London (https://www.ccpsynerbi.ac.uk/events/airbi/). All participants of PETRIC2 will be invited to submit an abstract at the beginning of December 2025 and will then have the opportunity to present their work at the Symposium. More information on the abstract and possible travel stipends will follow soon. 

## Questions?
We will update this page regularly and for more info please also have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/SyneRBI/PETRIC2/wiki). 
In the meantime you can check out our previous challenge [PETRIC](https://github.com/SyneRBI/PETRIC).

## Layout

The organisers will import your submitted algorithm from `main.py` and then run & evaluate it.
Please create this file! See the example `main_*.py` files for inspiration.

[SIRF](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF), [CIL](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL), and CUDA are already installed (using [synerbi/sirf](https://github.com/synerbi/SIRF-SuperBuild/pkgs/container/sirf)).
Additional dependencies may be specified via `apt.txt`, `environment.yml`, and/or `requirements.txt`.

- (required) `main.py`: must define a `class Submission(cil.optimisation.algorithms.Algorithm)` and a (potentially empty) list of `submission_callbacks`, e.g.:
  + [main_BSREM.py](main_BSREM.py)
  + [main_ISTA.py](main_ISTA.py)
  + [main_OSEM.py](main_OSEM.py)
- `apt.txt`: passed to `apt install`
- `environment.yml`: passed to `conda install`, e.g.:

  ```yml
  name: winning-submission
  channels: [conda-forge, nvidia]
  dependencies:
  - cupy
  - cuda-version =11.8
  - pip
  - pip:
    - git+https://github.com/MyResearchGroup/prize-winning-algos
  ```

- `requirements.txt`: passed to `pip install`, e.g.:

  ```txt
  cupy-cuda11x
  git+https://github.com/MyResearchGroup/prize-winning-algos
  ```

> [!TIP]
> You probably should create either an `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` file (but not both).

You can also find some example notebooks here which should help you with your development:

## Organiser Setup

The organisers will execute (after installing [nvidia-docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) & downloading <https://petric.tomography.stfc.ac.uk/data/> to `/path/to/data`):

**TODO: use synerbi/sirf:latest-gpu after the next SIRF release**

```sh
# 1. git clone & cd to your submission repository
# 2. mount `.` to container `/workdir`:
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -p 6006:6006 \
  -v /path/to/data:/mnt/share/petric:ro \
  -v .:/workdir -w /workdir synerbi/sirf:edge-gpu /bin/bash
# 3. install metrics & GPU libraries
conda install monai tensorboard tensorboardx jupytext cudatoolkit=11.8
pip uninstall torch # monai installs pytorch (CPU), so remove it
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]==2.14  # last to support cu118
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install git+https://github.com/TomographicImaging/Hackathon-000-Stochastic-QualityMetrics
# 4. optionally, conda/pip/apt install environment.yml/requirements.txt/apt.txt
# 5. run your submission
python petric.py &
# 6. optionally, serve logs at <http://localhost:6006>
tensorboard --bind_all --port 6006 --logdir ./output
```

## FAQ

See the [wiki/Home][wiki] and [wiki/FAQ](https://github.com/SyneRBI/PETRIC/wiki/FAQ) for more info.

> [!TIP]
> `petric.py` will effectively execute:
>
> ```python
> from main import Submission, submission_callbacks  # your submission (`main.py`)
> from petric import data, metrics  # our data & evaluation
> assert issubclass(Submission, cil.optimisation.algorithms.Algorithm)
> Submission(data).run(numpy.inf, callbacks=metrics + submission_callbacks)
> ```

---

> [!WARNING]
> To avoid timing out (currently 10 min runtime, will likely be increased a bit for the final evaluation after submissions close), please disable any debugging/plotting code before submitting!
> This includes removing any progress/logging from `submission_callbacks` and any debugging from `Submission.__init__`.

- `data` to test/train your `Algorithm`s is available at <https://petric.tomography.stfc.ac.uk/data/> and is likely to grow (more info to follow soon)
  + fewer datasets will be available during the submission phase, but more will be available for the final evaluation after submissions close
  + please contact us if you'd like to contribute your own public datasets!
- `metrics` are calculated by `class QualityMetrics` within `petric.py`
  + this does not contribute to your runtime limit
  + effectively, only `Submission(data).run(np.inf, callbacks=submission_callbacks)` is timed
- when using the temporary [leaderboard], it is best to:
  + change `Horizontal Axis` to `Relative`
  + untick `Ignore outliers in chart scaling`
  + see [the wiki](https://github.com/SyneRBI/PETRIC/wiki#metrics-and-thresholds) for details

Any modifications to `petric.py` are ignored.
